Express + TypeScript API for TalentTrust, a milestone-based freelancer escrow protocol on Stellar.
The API mirrors the state machine of the Soroban escrow contract
([Talenttrust-Contracts](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts)) so clients and
freelancers can create engagements, fund escrow, release milestones, raise disputes and build reputation.

Storage is in-memory (seeded with demo data), so no database is required. On serverless hosting the
data is per-instance and resets on redeploy.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3001
npm run lint     # type check
npm test
npm run build && npm start
```

Configuration (all optional, see `.env.example`): `PORT`, `ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID`, `STELLAR_NETWORK`,
`STELLAR_RPC_URL`, `CHAIN_READ_TTL_MS`, `FRONTEND_URL`. Chain reads are cached for 5 seconds by
default and identical concurrent reads share one Soroban simulation. Chain read endpoints are also
limited to 60 requests per minute per client. Amounts from the chain are returned as decimal
strings so large `i128` values remain exact.

The chain contract endpoint returns the escrow fields (`id`, parties, token, milestones, totals,
status, and `reputationIssued`) together with `source: "chain"` and `latestLedger`. The reputation
endpoint returns the completed-contract count, total rating, and the same two-decimal average used
by the existing off-chain `/api/v1/reputation/:address` resource.

Example chain response:

```json
{
  "id": "1", "client": "G...", "freelancer": "G...", "token": "C...",
  "milestones": [{ "index": 0, "amount": "1000000", "released": false }],
  "totalAmount": "1000000", "fundedAmount": "0", "releasedAmount": "0",
  "status": "Created", "reputationIssued": false, "source": "chain", "latestLedger": 123
}
```
`LOG_LEVEL` (debug|info|warn|error|silent, default info; silent in tests) is also supported.

Every request is assigned a correlation id. Send `X-Request-Id` (must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{8,128}$`) and it is echoed back in the
`X-Request-Id` response header and included in every error JSON body. Access logs are emitted as structured JSON (one line per request) and
unexpected 500s are logged with a stack trace (never leaked to the client). Authorization, `x-api-key` and `Cookie` header values are redacted
and request bodies are never logged.

Standalone server timeouts (env, all optional): `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 65000),
`HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 66000, must be > keep-alive), `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30000).
`SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` (default 10000) controls how long to wait for in-flight requests on shutdown.
`PORT` is validated: non-integer or out-of-range (1–65535) values cause a fast fail with a clear message.

On SIGTERM/SIGINT the server stops accepting connections, sets `Connection: close` on responses,
returns `503 { status: 'draining' }` from `/health` while draining, waits for in-flight requests up to
the grace deadline, then force-closes remaining sockets and exits.

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel as a serverless function: `api/index.ts` exports the Express app and
`vercel.json` rewrites every path to it. `src/index.ts` only calls `listen()` when run directly.

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```
